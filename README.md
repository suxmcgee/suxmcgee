- 👋 Hi, I’m @suxmcgee
- 👀 I’m interested in 3d printing, homelab stuff, home automation, and that's just in the past 5 minutes.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use the 3d printer my fiance got me for Christmas, and exploring all the cool mods and add-ons for it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I'm here to learn & help things grow.
- 📫 How to reach me: you don't.
