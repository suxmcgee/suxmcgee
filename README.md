- 👋 Hi, I’m @suxmcgee
- 👀 I’m interested in 3d printing, homelab stuff, home automation, and that's just in the past 5 minutes. I work in IT so most of my experience is based on Microsoft technologies but I am trying to build outside of that.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how best to use the 3d printer my fiance got me for Christmas, and exploring all the cool mods and add-ons. I just discovered two raspberry pi zero w that I bought back on Pi day maybe 5-ish years ago, but never set up, and simultaneously I realized they were too weak for Octoprint so I bought a zero 2 w instead from Micro Center for $15, which I guess means I got lucky since they're pretty hard to find now. Octoprint runs great on it. I am also starting an obsession with rPi stuff. I managed to score a 4b 4GB new from an official supplier, and an Argon m.2 case, so now I am exploring the world of rPi too. This has motivated me to start tinkering with all of the electronics I've hoarded over the years in an attempt to integrate them all, or rule them out of the picture completely. Kind of a pre-purge setup, if you will. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing at the moment. I'm here to learn & help things grow.
- 📫 How to reach me: you don't.
